# CookHelper-Project
Recipe adding, viewing, and searching program. SEG 2105 Final Project
I created a new repository as Joe suggested because git hub will not allow you to mass delete files in the master branch.
I highly suggest when working on things that you create branches for them so that the master branch files don't get messed up.
At the end of the project we should commit all  of our work to the master branch to consolidate everything.
